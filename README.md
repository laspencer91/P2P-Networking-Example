# P2P-Networking-Example
Peer 2 Peer Networking Example In Gamemaker Studio 2

This is an example project of a simple Peer To Peer networked game. Check out my live streams to see most of its development here.
(Skip through the hours that I get stuck on a couple things xD)

## How to play
You can open multiple instance of GM and run the game or compile into .zip and open as many as you want. The first instance needs to HOST
and the rest of the instances will need to join with Unique ports set. (Cant be the same as host, and cant be the same as any of the
Clients). 

You can press CONTROL at the main menu to insert a name if you would like. Once in game. On the host, press "R", to start the countdown
timer. Once the timer is up, the clients will spawn. No friendly fire available, so you must spawn more than 3 players in to get someone
on the other team.

## To start learning the project
Start in the NetworkSpawner object, and the main menu buttons. You can follow them through. I give a quick walkthrough at the end of 
my second Youtube stream. The code and structure could be MUCHHH better but I was in a little rush to get this one complete!
Will add more detail here soon.....
